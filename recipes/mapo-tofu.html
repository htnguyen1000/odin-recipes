    <p> <h3>What is Mapo Tofu?</h3></p>

    <p>Mapo Tofu is a popular Chinese dish from Sichuan Province, where spicy food is king and the signature spice of the region--the Sichuan Peppercorn--gives dishes a unique “numbing” effect. It's almost like the Sichuan peppercorns are there to not only add their fragrance and flavor, but also to numb your tongue so it can take more heat!</p>

    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup oil</li>
        <li>6-8 fresh Thai bird chili peppers</li>
        <li>1/2 - 1 1/2 tablespoons Sichuan peppercorns</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ginger </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons garlic </li>
        <li>8 oz ground pork </li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoon douban jiang</li>
        <li>2/3 cup low sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 pound silken tofu</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>scallion (green onion)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, we toast the chilies. If you have homemade toasted chili oil, you can skip this step. Heat your wok or a small saucepan over low heat. Add ¼ cup of the oil and throw in the fresh and dried peppers. Stir occasionally and heat until fragrant, about 5 minutes, ensuring that the peppers don't burn. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining ¼ cup of oil in your wok over medium heat. Add the ginger. After 1 minute, add the garlic. Fry for another minute, and then turn up the heat to high and add the ground pork. Break up the meat and fry it until it's cooked through. Add your ground Sichuan peppercorns and stir for about 15-30 seconds, taking care to not let it burn, as it will turn bitter if it does.</li>
            <li>Add the spicy bean sauce to the mixture and stir it in well. Add ⅔ cups of chicken broth to the wok and stir. Let this simmer for a minute or so. While that's happening, ready your tofu and also put a ¼ cup of water in a small bowl with your cornstarch and mix until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Add the cornstarch mixture to your sauce and stir. Let it bubble away until the sauce starts to thicken. (If it gets too thick, splash in a little more water or chicken stock.)</li>
            <li>Then add your chili oil from before—peppers and all! If you are using homemade chili oil, ONLY use the standing oil, as it's likely that you have salted it and you only want the oil, not additional salt. Stir the oil into the sauce, and add the tofu. Use your spatula to gently toss the tofu in the sauce. Let everything cook for 3-5 minutes. Add the sesame oil and sugar (if using) along with the scallions and stir until the scallions are just wilted.</li>
            <li>Serve with a last sprinkle of Sichuan peppercorn powder as a garnish if desired.</li>
        </ol>
