    <p> <h3>What is Banh Cuon?</h3></p>

    <p>Vietnamese Steamed Rice Rolls or, Bánh Cuốn, are thin sheets of steamed rice batter filled with ground pork and minced wood ear mushrooms.</p>

    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <strong>Batter:</strong>
        <li>2 cup rice flour</li>
        <li>1 cup potato starch</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tapioca starch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>5.5 cups of water</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
        <strong>Nuoc Cham Dipping Sauce:</strong>
        <li>lime juice </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Asian fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 chilies</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul>
        <strong>Pork filing:</strong>
        <li>1/2 lb ground pork</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chicken stock powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>1 small onion diced</li>
        <li>1/2 dried Wood Ear Mushroom (soaked and rinsed in water for 30 mins)</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>For the pork filling: Marinate the ground pork with pork/chicken stock powder, salt, sugar, and pepper for 15 minutes. In a large pan, heat up vegetable oil on medium-high heat. Add the garlic and onion. Saute until fragrant (1-2 minutes). Add seasoned ground pork and mushroom. Break up the chunks of ground pork with a wooden spoon. Continue cooking until pork is cooked all the way through.</li>
            <li>For the batter: Add everything in a medium-size bowl and stir until dissolved.</li>
            <li>To make the steam rolls, pour a little batter into the hot nonstick pan, just enough to cover the bottom. You want it as thin as possible. If it's a really good non-stick pan, no oil will be needed. Cover the pan with a lid and let it steam for about one minute. Once cooked, slide the "crepe" onto an oiled plate. Add a thin layer of the pork mixture then roll it up. Repeat until all batter and filling are gone. Slather the rice rolls with a bit of scallion oil for a nice aromatic shine, then serve with cucumbers, bean sprouts, Vietnamese pork sausage, fried shallots, and Vietnamese fish sauce dipping sauce (Nước Mắm Chấm) on the side.</li>
        </ol>
